  Psychopy doesn't work with pyglet 1.4 currently. Check that you have an older version installed, 
  otherwise uninstall your current version of pyglet and specify an older one.
  For example, installing via pip:
  
  ```
  pip install pyglet==1.3.0b1
  ```

### Running

Run the file `target/main.py` in your Psychopy 3 environment.

On Linux you can execute the following command in the project's root directory:
